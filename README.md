# FG-Effect-Builder
Extension for Fantasy Grounds which assists in creating effects

To access the Effect Builder type `/buildeffect` or `/effectbuilder` into the chat box.
After your effect string is fully constructed you may copy & paste or drag & drop the string wherever you need it.

Currently the builder supports most D&D 3.5 / Pathfinder effects. It can also be used to build effects for other rulesets with similar effects (D&D 5E notably)
